Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit
2. Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

Answer : 
 	The problem with using PORTD = 0x04; is that it directly assigns the value 0x04 to all the bits of PORTD, affecting the entire port. This means that bits 5-3, which are connected to the buttons, will be reset to 0, causing the buttons to stop working. The reason is that assigning a value to PORTD overwrites all the bits, not just bit 2, which controls the LED. As a result, the input state of the buttons is lost since bits 5-3 will no longer reflect the button inputs.

To fix this, we should only modify bit 2 (for the LED) while preserving the current states of bits 5-3 (the buttons). This can be done by using a bitwise OR operation, which ensures that only bit 2 is set to 1, leaving the other bits unchanged.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:


Code:
	PORTD |= 0x04;

By using the bitwise OR (|=) operation, the LED is turned on while the other bits (including bits 5-3 for the buttons) remain unchanged, ensuring the buttons continue to work properly.




Hint: ignore the hardware propagation delays which are very small (tens of ns),
and think about how your program executes.
